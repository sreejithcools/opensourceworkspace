/**
 * This demo application takes a stream broadcasted from a Flash player and
 * decodes, re-samples, and re-encodes the audio on that stream to produce
 * 5.5KHZ stero PCM audio.  It drops all the video.
 * <p> 
 * To use install the application to a Red5 server and connect to the "audiotranscoder"
 * application.
 * </p><p>
 * <b>
 * YOU MUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INSTALLED XUGGLER ON THE MACHINE RUNNING YOUR RED5 SERVER.
 * 
 * See http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler
 * </b>
 * </p><p>

 * Then publish (you can use the "demos/publisher/publisher.html" application) an audio
 * stream with a unique name (e.g. "my_stream").
 * </p><p>
 * To hear your transcoded audio stream, connect to the same application and then playback
 * a stream that has the same unique name, but with "xuggle_" appended to it (e.g. "xuggle_my_stream").
 * </p><p>
 * You should hear the audio you are broadcasting, just re-encoded at the new parameters.  Please
 * note that while you will hear a latency in this audio, approximately 3-msec is added by our transcoder --
 * the rest is coming from your network, from red5, and from the fact that (probably) you've set your
 * buffer time on your flash NetStream object to 2 seconds.  To see exactly how fast transcoding is,
 * check out the performance metrics that this application outputs every few seconds.
